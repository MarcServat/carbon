# Summary

Introduce first class support for internationalisation and localisation within `carbon-react`.

# Basic example

The proposal is to create a new `I18nProvider` component that allows carbon components to look 
up translations by key. We will provide `en-GB` translations. Consumers are able to extend
existing locales if necessary.

We will need to check each usage of our current `i18n-js` implementation to ensure the:
* key makes sense;
* translations are provided in each of our supported languages; and
* interpolation/plural/formatting works correctly.

We will deprecate our `I18n` component. This component consumes `i18n-js` directly and formats any Markdown content.
There are better alternatives for Markdown, such as [`react-markdown`](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown) which 
avoids `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Our consumers can use `react-markdown` and `react-i18next` in tandem. Removing the
`I18n` from carbon allows our consumers to patch any Markdown parsing vulnerabilities without requiring a new 
`carbon-react` release.

We will also deprecate all [`i18n` helpers][1]. Continuing to support these is beyond the scope of a component library
and is better handled by a dedicated library such as [`numeral.js`](http://numeraljs.com/). Removing these will further
reduce the complexity of this project and allow for more advanced configurations by our consumers. Where we use these
helpers internally, we will use a dedicated library if appropriate. We will ensure that any new i18n helpers are
considered as private methods i.e. marked as `@private` or not exported.

Each translation will be overridable by creating their own locale. In some cases we'll also add props if the 
translation is frequently overridden.

Finally, consumers can integrate with an existing translation provider e.g. `i18next` by creating a custom locale.

# Motivation

We currently only publish english translations. Each time a product launches in a non-english market they have to set up
translations, these are typically non-contextual and will be the same in each product. We want to simplify this process.

It's not possible to override translations on a per component basis.

Having `i18n-js` as a peer-dependency means that we are encouraging the use of this, unintentionally, for content
translations. The current recommended setup is `i18next`, so consumers will have to configure both libraries, increasing
the bundle size and reducing performance.

# Detailed design

```js
// carbon/__internal__/i18n-context/index.js
import { createContext } from "react";
import enGB from "../../locales/en-gb";

export default createContext(enGB);
```

```js
// carbon/locales/en-gb.js
export default {
  locale: () => "en-Gb",
  pager: {
    show: () => "Show",
    records: (count, showNumber = true) => {
      const noun = isSingular(count) ? "item" : "items";
      return showNumber ? `${count} ${noun}` : noun;
    },
    first: () => "First",
    last: () => "Last",
    next: () =>  "Next",
    previous: () => "Previous",
    pageX: () => "Page",
    ofY: (count) => `of ${count}`,
  },
};

```

```js
// carbon/components/i18n-provider.component.js
import React from "react";
import merge from "lodash/merge";
import Context from "../../__internal__/i18n-context";
import enGB from "../../locales/en-gb";

const I18nProvider = ({ locale, children }) =>
  locale ? (
    <Context.Provider value={merge(enGB, locale)}>{children}</Context.Provider>
  ) : (
    children
  );
```

```js
// carbon/components/pager.component.js
import useLocale from "../../hooks/__internal__/useLocale";
export default ({
  pageSize = 25,
  currentPage = 1,
  totalRecords = 100,
  ...props
}) => {
  const l = useLocale();
  const numberOfPages = Math.round(totalRecords / pageSize);

  const pageTranslation = props.pageTranslation || l.pager.ofY();
  const itemsTranslation = props.itemsTranslation || l.pager.records();

  return (
    <div className="row">
      <div className="column">
        `${currentPage} ${pageTranslation(numberOfPages)} ${itemsTranslation(pageSize, false)}`
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```js
// consumer/app.js
import Pager from "carbon-react/lib/components/pager";
import I18nProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/i18n-provider";
import enXG from "./locales/en-xg";
import { toWords } from "number-to-words";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Default enGB */}
      <Pager pageSize={25} />
      {/* Custom locale */}
      <I18nProvider locale={enXG}>
        <Pager pageSize={25} />
        <Pager pageSize={1} />
      </I18nProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js
// consumer/locales/en-xg.js
// This example locale extends enGB
import enGB from "carbon-react/lib/locales/en-gb";
export default { 
  ...enGB,
  locale: () => "enXG",
  pager: {
    ...enGB.pager,
    records: (count, showNumber = true) => {
      const noun = parseInt(count, 10) === 1 ? "item" : "items";
      return showNumber ? `${count} (${noun})` : noun;
    },
  }
}
```

```js
// consumer/locales/i18next
// This example locale uses i18next
import i18next from 'i18next';
export default {
  locale: () => i18next.language,
  Pager: {
    items: pageSize => i18next.t("carbon:pager.items", {count: pageSize}),
    page: (currentPage, numberOfPages) => i18next.t("carbon:pager.page", {currentPage, numberOfPages})
  }
}
```

# Drawbacks

1. This will be a breaking change, our consumers will have to migrate any existing translations from `i18n-js`.
This is partially mitigated by the translations that we will be providing out of the box. We should ask for translation
contributions from our consumers.
1. We have ~78 usages of `i18n-js` that we will need to convert.

# Alternatives

I had previously suggested in this RFC to introduce a new component `I18nProvider` that allows our consumers to provide a 
[`react-i18next`](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) compatible `t` function. However, when this was implemented
it was apparent that this abstraction in practice would force our consumers to use a specific version of `react-i18next`
and maintaining a compatible adapter was overly complex.

When we reviewed the progress we established that we want:
* minimal configuration
* a default translation configured (`en-GB`) with the ability to extend
* our consumers to have the freedom to use the packages that are most suitable for their project

# Adoption strategy

This will be a breaking change. We will need to document the upgrade process and link to it in the release notes.

# How we teach this

This will be added to our getting started guide and to our docs in storybook. We will share this RFC internally as well
as the breaking change.
