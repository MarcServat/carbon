# Tile

Tiles are containers for static content such as text, and don't contain controls.

## Contents

- [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Props](#props)

## Quick Start

```javascript
import {
  Tile,
  TileContent,
  TileFooter,
  FlexTileContainer,
  FlexTileCell,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/tile";
```

## Designer notes

- Tiles should be reserved for static content. If you require a container with controls or interactive content, use the <LinkTo kind='Card' story='default-story'>Card component</LinkTo> instead.

## Examples

### Default

By default, the Tile component will have a horizontal layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.DefaultStory} />
</Canvas>

### Roundness variants for corners

<Canvas>
  <Story name="large roundness" story={stories.LargeRoundness} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="small roundness" story={stories.SmallRoundness} />
</Canvas>

### Vertical

The Tile component can be also have a vertical layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="vertical" story={stories.Vertical} />
</Canvas>

### With TileFooter

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with TileFooter" story={stories.WithTileFooter} />
</Canvas>

### With TileHeader

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with TileHeader" story={stories.WithTileHeader} />
</Canvas>

### With Button in TileHeader

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with Button in TileHeader" story={stories.WithButtonInTileHeader} />
</Canvas>

### With custom widths

The Tile component can also have a custom `width` which accepts either numbers or strings: any decimal between 0 and 1.0
will be converted into a percentage, any number greater will be be treated as pixels and any valid CSS string will also work.
Any child wrapped by a Tile component can be passed an optional `width` prop if its interface supports it.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="custom Widths" story={stories.CustomWidths} />
</Canvas>

### With custom heights

The Tile component can also have a custom `height` which accepts either numbers or strings: any decimal between 0 and 1.0
will be converted into a percentage, any number greater will be be treated as pixels and any valid CSS string will also work.
Any child wrapped by a Tile component can be passed an optional `height` prop if its interface supports it.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="custom heights" story={stories.CustomHeights} />
</Canvas>

### Active Tile

<Canvas>
  <Story name="active" story={stories.Active} />
</Canvas>

### Grey variant

<Canvas>
  <Story name="grey" story={stories.Grey} />
</Canvas>

### Custom borders

You can set the `borderVariant` property to alter the border colour as well as the border width with the `borderWidth` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="custom borders" story={stories.CustomBorders} />
</Canvas>

### With inline styling

The Tile component can also have inline styling applied to the content.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with Inline" story={stories.WithInline} />
</Canvas>

### With different padding and margin

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with different padding and margin"
    story={stories.WithDifferentPaddingAndMargin}
  />
</Canvas>

### With Definition List

The Definition List component should only be used inside of the Tile component. The purpose of the Definition List component is to mimic
the same tags used in HTML5 but instead they are React elements.

Please note that Dl, Dd and Dt use our common spacing props.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with Definition List - default"
    story={stories.WithDefinitionListDefault}
  />
</Canvas>

### With Definition List and custom `StyledDtDiv` width

Providing a number value to the `w` prop, sets the width of the `<Dt />` element as a percentage. The remaining percentage is then assigned to `<Dd />` to occupy the available space.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with Definition List and custom width"
    story={stories.WithDefinitionListAndCustomWidth}
  />
</Canvas>

### With Definition List with custom text alignment

In this example `dtTextAlign` has been provided the string 'left' and `ddTextAlign` has been provided the string 'right'.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with Definition and custom text alignment"
    story={stories.WithDefinitionListAndCustomTextAlignment}
  />
</Canvas>

### With Definition List and ActionPopover and Icon support

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with Definition List and ActionPopover and Icon support"
    story={stories.WithDefinitionListAndActionPopoverAndIconSupport}
  />
</Canvas>

### With Accordion and Definition List

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with Accordion" story={stories.WithAccordion} />
</Canvas>

### With Accordion and TileFooter

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with Accordion and TileFooter"
    story={stories.WithAccordionAndTileFooter}
  />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile

To make the content of a tile responsive, use `FlexTileCell` components inside a `FlexTileContainer`.
The content of a `FlexTileCell` can be what you want.

When the size of the screen is too small to display all the cells on one line, some will be automatically wrapped to a new line.
If you add a `FlexTileDivider` in each cell, a divider will appear between the lines.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Tile" story={stories.ResponsiveDefaultStory} />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile with custom gaps

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Tile with custom gaps" story={stories.CustomGaps} />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile with fixed width for cells

With `flexGrow={0}`, the width of each cell will be defined by `flexBasis`. It will not grow or shrink according to the remaining space.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Responsive Tile with fixed width for cells"
    story={stories.FixedContainers}
  />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile with flex width for cells

If `flexGrow` is **not** `0`, the width (= `flexBasis`) of each cell will be a min-width. It will grow to fill the remaining space and shrink until reaching that min-width.
You can use `maxWidth` to constrain the growth.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Responsive Tile with flex width for cells"
    story={stories.FlexContainers}
  />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile with proportionate widths

Responsive cells can be set so that they have a proportionate width to other cells in the same tile.

Use this values on `flexGrow`:

- 1: The remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all cells.
- 2: That cell will try to take up twice as much of the space than the others.
- 3: That cell will try to take up thrice as much of the space than the others.
- ...

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Responsive Tile with proportionate widths"
    story={stories.ProportionateWidths}
  />
</Canvas>

### Responsive Tile with align content

Use `justifyContent` to place your content inside the width allocated to the cell.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Tile with align content" story={stories.Align} />
</Canvas>
